                The audio levels seem to be a big problem for us all even though quality of captured audio is really good.

In general, the following needs to happen:
- Compression and normalisation of audio to improve levels
- This sadly cranks up the background noise, so adding light noise reduction helps
- graphic equaliser to improve voice tone also helps speech clarity making it less boomy and bassy

This can all be carried out in iMovie before uploading your final clip
