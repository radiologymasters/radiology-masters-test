                Dr Daniel Fascia & Dr Nick Wambeek along with a team at Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia have invented a new method for assessment of the patellofemoral joint during realtime patient active movement.

This motion analysis has not previously been possible and offers new horizons for the diagnosis and operative planning of this important condition. 

It offers orthopaedic surgeons a diagnostic advantage and useful 3D data for the planning of tibial tubercle osteotomies, trochleoplasty and soft tissue operations on the PFJ.
